 //Create a new repository with your partner. Download the penguin zip file unzip it. It will include a set of images as well as a 
 penguin json file. You are to create an App to present penguin data in a table format.

Your table should have columns for the images, the mean quiz, the homework mean, the tests mean, as well as the final score. 
Each column of the table should be clickable and will sort the table by descending values in that column. Finally, all penguins 
whose total grade is less than 70 should have some visual indication that they are in trouble. Recall that total grades 
(final 35%, Tests 30%, Quizes 20%, and HW is 15%). Effective use of CSS is a requirement to completing this assignment.

Students wishing to do something extra should add a feature where when they click on a row, the webpage will be erased and replaced
with a details page for a single penguin(i.e. all quiz and hw data).

Hints: First, it might be easier to complete this assignment if you transform your penguin data to add summary info to each 
penguin. Second, good use of functions will make or break you on this lab. One function to draw the table, means you can 
recall that function each time you click on one of the headers.Third, this is pretty much a refresher before the next test. 
Don't just go back and copy your code from the previous labs. Rework the statistics. If you are having a hard time, you need 
the practice.//
